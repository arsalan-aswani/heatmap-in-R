Website Traffic Heatmap in R 

A heatmap to visualize website traffic patterns across different hours of the day and days of the week. Using tidyverse, it creates sample visitor data, reshapes it with tidyr, and plots a heatmap using ggplot2. The color gradient highlights traffic intensity, making it easy to identify peak and low-traffic periods.
